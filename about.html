			   Pune Municipal Corporation has been working and planning towards making Pune 
			   environment friendly and healthy in every possible way. 
			   Sewage Treatment Projects are important aspects in this exercise
			</p>
			<p> <span style="font-size:18px;font-weight:bold; font-family: 'Autour One';">History :<br></span> <br>
				The very first sewerage system for Pune city was designed in 1928. 
				The collected sewage was given preliminary treatment such as screening and 
				grit removal at BhairobaNala, and it was used for irrigation purpose by pumping 17.
				5 Nalli canal area. This system was designed for 31.8 MLD to cater to the ultimate 
				design capacity for population of 0.26 million in the year 1951.<br><br>
			
			
			    In the year 1981, a complete collection and disposal system was planned taking into 
				account the adjoining areas where population was expected to increase. A 90 MLD 
				Sewage Treatment Plant was constructed at Dr Naidu I.D. Hospital. The treated sewage is 
				let off into the Mula-Mutha river. There is an intermediate pumping station at Kasba Peth 
				of 90 MLD capacity from where sewage is pumped into the sewage treatment plant at Dr Naidu 
				Hospital.Up to the year 1997, the total main sewer length in all the zones was approximately 
				146.83 km, in old Pune city limit. Dr Naidu Sewage Treatment Plant with full-fledged primary 
				and secondary sewage treatment facility was treating 90 MLD sewage, and Bhairoba Nalasewage 
				treatment plant with primary sewage treatment facility was treating 32 MLD sewage.Existing S
				ewerage Facilities in Pune.<br><br>
			Considering the increase in the area under the jurisdiction of PMC (430 sq.km) and 
			a rapid rise in population, the project plan for water supply and sewerage services 
			was revised and completed in the year 2005</p>
